Weather Data Integration using Adapter Design Pattern

Problem Statement

WeatherApplication till now used only one weather service provider i.e. PrivateWeatherAPI. Now it wants to use third party services such as OpenWeatherAPI & WeatherStackAPI.
But this application faces challenges due to the differences in API structures while fetching weather data from various providers, method names, and data formats. For instance, one provider may return temperature in Celsius while another uses Fahrenheit. This inconsistency makes it difficult to integrate and use data from multiple providers in a seamless manner.

Solution

The Adapter Design Pattern offers a solution by using a unified interface WeatherService, which was already being used by Weather Application, for interacting with different APIs such as OpenWeatherAPI & WeatherStackAPI. By creating adapters for each weather data provider, the application can standardize the way data is fetched and processed, regardless of the provider's unique API structure.
